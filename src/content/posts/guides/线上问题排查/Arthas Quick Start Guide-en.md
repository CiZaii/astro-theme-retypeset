# üõ†Ô∏è Arthas Introduction

Arthas is a powerful Java diagnostic tool open-sourced by Alibaba in September 2018. It supports JDK 6 and above, provides interactive command-line mode, supports multiple platforms (Linux/Mac/Windows), and features Tab auto-completion. Arthas helps developers quickly diagnose and locate Java application production issues without modifying code or restarting services.

## ü§î Why Do We Need Arthas?

In daily development, when encountering the following Java issues, traditional methods are inefficient:

- CPU load spikes, but unable to locate specific threads
- Thread deadlocks causing system freeze, difficult to view thread status in real-time
- Application response becomes slow, method call chain unclear
- Suspicion of online code inconsistency with local environment
- Unable to debug online issues, can only check logs

Arthas provides powerful solutions for these scenarios.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Download and run with a single command:

```bash
# Download arthas-boot.jar
curl -O https://arthas.aliyun.com/arthas-boot.jar

# Launch Arthas
java -jar arthas-boot.jar
```

### Selecting Target Process

After startup, Arthas will automatically detect all Java processes on the current machine:

```
[INFO] arthas-boot version: 3.x.x
[INFO] Process:
* [1]: 35542 (Spring Boot Application)
  [2]: 71560 (Tomcat Application)
  [3]: 63914 (Other Java Process)
Please choose the target process (1-3, default is 1):
```

Simply enter the number to attach to the target process.

## üéØ Core Commands

# Only show calls that take more than 100ms
```

#### `monitor` - Method Execution Statistics

**Monitor method execution statistics:**
```bash
[arthas@35542]$ monitor -c 5 com.example.UserService getUserById
# Monitor for 5 seconds and show statistics
```

### 4. JVM Analysis Commands

#### `dashboard` - System Overview

```bash
[arthas@35542]$ dashboard
# Real-time display of system metrics: CPU, memory, GC, threads, etc.
```

#### `jvm` - JVM Information

```bash
[arthas@35542]$ jvm
# View JVM version, parameters, memory allocation, etc.
```

#### `memory` - Memory Information

```bash
[arthas@35542]$ memory
# View heap/non-heap memory usage details
```

#### `gc` - GC Information

```bash
[arthas@35542]$ gc
# View garbage collection statistics
```

### 5. Class Loading Commands

#### `classloader` - View ClassLoader Information

# View classes loaded by specified ClassLoader
```

#### `mc` and `redefine` - Hot Code Replacement

**Compile Java source:**
```bash
[arthas@35542]$ mc /tmp/UserService.java -d /tmp
# Compile UserService.java to /tmp directory
```

**Hot replace class:**
```bash
[arthas@35542]$ redefine /tmp/com/example/UserService.class
# Hot replace UserService class
```

## üåê Web Console

Arthas also provides a Web interface for easier use:

```bash
# Start with Web Console
java -jar arthas-boot.jar --target-ip 0.0.0.0

Then access `http://localhost:8563` in your browser.

## üìä Practical Troubleshooting Examples

### Example 1: Troubleshooting High CPU Issues

```bash
# Step 1: View high CPU threads
[arthas@35542]$ thread -n 5

# Step 2: View specific thread details
[arthas@35542]$ thread 42

# Step 3: Trace suspected methods
[arthas@35542]$ trace com.example.service.ProcessService process
```

### Example 2: Method Performance Analysis

```bash
# Monitor method execution time
[arthas@35542]$ watch com.example.UserService getUserById '{params[0], returnObj, cost}' -x 2

# Trace method call chain
[arthas@35542]$ trace com.example.UserService getUserById '#cost > 50'
```

### Example 3: Deadlock Detection

```bash
# Detect deadlocks
[arthas@35542]$ thread -b

# View blocked thread details
[arthas@35542]$ thread 28
```

### Example 4: Memory Leak Investigation

```bash
# Monitor GC situation
[arthas@35542]$ gc

# View heap memory details
[arthas@35542]$ memory

# Monitor object creation
[arthas@35542]$ watch java.util.ArrayList <init> '{params, target}' -x 2
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Environment Considerations

### Performance Impact

1. **Minimal Impact**: Arthas has very low performance overhead under normal use
2. **Heavy Commands**: Commands like `watch`, `trace` may have some impact
3. **Recommended**: Test in staging environment first

### Security Considerations

```bash
# Set access restrictions
java -jar arthas-boot.jar --target-ip 127.0.0.1 --http-port 8563 --telnet-port 3658
```

### Resource Management

```bash
# Exit Arthas
[arthas@35542]$ quit

# Stop Arthas completely
[arthas@35542]$ stop
```

## üéÅ Advanced Features

```bash
# Start profiler
[arthas@35542]$ profiler start

# Generate flame graph
[arthas@35542]$ profiler getSamples
[arthas@35542]$ profiler status
```

### Log Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor log output
[arthas@35542]$ logger

# Change log level
[arthas@35542]$ logger --name com.example --level DEBUG
```

### OGNL Expression Support

```bash
# Use OGNL expressions in watch command
[arthas@35542]$ watch com.example.UserService getUserById '@user.name'

# Get static field value

# Filter by parameter values
[arthas@35542]$ watch com.example.UserService getUserById 'params[0] > 1000'
```

### 2. Batch Operations

```bash
# Monitor multiple methods
[arthas@35542]$ monitor -c 10 com.example.UserService *
```

### 3. Result Export

```bash
# Export results to file
[arthas@35542]$ trace com.example.UserService getUserById > /tmp/trace.log
```
